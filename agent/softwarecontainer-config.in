# General SoftwareContainer configuration.
#
# Optional configs are commented out by default, but are set to the default
# values that will be used by SoftwareContainer if nothing else is specified.
#
# Any configs that are not commented out by default are mandatory and must
# be present and set to a valid value by the user. The exception to this is
# configs that have been asked to be set during CMake configuration for
# convenience purposes. Configs like that will be present in this file while
# not strictly mandatory. This is to enable some development and testing
# convenience.
#
# Config keys are unique to their respective group. Consequently, the same
# config key can appear in different groups. It is an error to move a config
# from its group.
#
# Config groups that are not commented out are mandatory.
