How to contribute
=================
We are happy to accept contributions. To accept a contribution, we require two things:

* A developer certificate of origin: see http://developercertificate.org/
    - A "signed-off-by" line in the commits is interpreted as a DCO from our perspective
    - Use your real name and e-mail address
* A signature of the SoftwareContainer CLA: see
  https://www.clahub.com/agreements/Pelagicore/softwarecontainer
  - We don't like CLAs but we have to have one. We'll remove it as soon as we can.

We aim to follow the [https://wiki.gnome.org/Git/CommitMessages](GNOME guidelines) for commit
messages.

Help wanted
===========
If you don't know what to start with, there are some general topics that we want to see more
activity around.

* Look for bad practices (easy)
    - We try to follow a reasonable code standard, but we fail sometimes. Please suggest changes
      when we fail.
* Security hardening SoftwareContainer (hard)
    - Make it harder to break out of containment
    - Add security features that are missing
* Use some different backend (hard)
    - Currently we're only using LXC, but it would be great to see more available backends
